And many more... . So analysing this dataset helps the company in many way. Now coming to ZOMATO: Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. As of 2019, the service is available in 24 countries and in more than 10,000 cities. For such a company Reviews are the most important criteria to analyse their own companies performance. So we are going to analyse this dataset using EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis and its helping components. We will visualise this dataset using graphs and maps at the same time we will filter out all the reviews using their rating values and find the reasons behind the high rating as well as its low ratings. Which will help the company to understand what to change so that their reviews will increase and be more positive. So lets jump into analysis now......"
